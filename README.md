# Word-Guess-Game
I created a game similar to hangman based off the TV series The Office.

A random word will pop up
Hit any letter to start guessing the word
You have 9 guesses
If you guess the word, you win
If you guess wrong or run out of guesses, you loose
The guesses left only goes down if you guess wrong
The wins tracks how many rounds you won
The losses trackes how many rounds you have lost

I created the a var list that held all the words the user could guess. I then created a function that displayed the random word for the user. Once they guessed the word correctly or used all their guesses it would switch to the next word. I created an if, else if function to display a different image for each word.
